## Hello Beyonce

This was part of the code I developed with 3 other team members during Code First Girl's Kickstarter course on web development. 

### My role
- I designed the large hero section ([first thing you see on the page]([url](https://mirabellemorah.github.io/beyonce-CFG/)))
- I added javascript to the "listen section" to allow for a smooth scrolling experience
- Worked on the album cards to make them responsive
- Added animations to the website using gradients and hover effects
- Presented on behalf of the entire group, the functionalities we created.

Note that for many of us, this was one of the first times we would be working with codes, and this was meant to be an introductory exercise.
